### Metrics for Random Forest Classification w/ GridSearchCV:
Received 0.79 accuracy on the training data.
Received 0.58 accuracy on the testing data.

### Model Justification:
With this data set I would not be able to help solve our business problem.

### Recommendations:
* Obtain more data. Out of 7500 rows 5500 were dropped as duplicate.
* Obtain more features. There are so many more features that describe wine. The more we have, I am sure we would be able to find more correlations.
